# Neuralizer: Flash of Memory

Recreate the iconic neuralizer from Men In Black! This web-based app uses your phone's flashlight and sound to simulate the memory-wiping flash effect. Now fully responsive and available as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## 🙌 Motivation
* Inspired by the Men In Black franchise.
* After looking for it on the Google Playstore and not finding it, I came up with the idea. I needed it for a Halloween party my co-workers and I held. I looked for images samples of the device and then designed it on Figma. Once I was satisfied with the design, I developed it.


## 🚀 Features  
- Interactive flashlight and sound effect simulation.
- Fully functional as a PWA—installable and offline-capable.
- Cross-device compatibility for smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
- Built with pure web technologies for accessibility and ease of use.
